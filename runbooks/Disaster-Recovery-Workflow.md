# Disaster Recovery Workflow
*Runbook for Disaster Recovery in the AWS Multi-Account Landing Zone*

---

## Purpose
This runbook provides the **process for responding to and recovering from disasters** that impact the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of workloads in the AWS multi-account landing zone.  
It aligns with **AWS Well-Architected Framework (Reliability Pillar)** and **NIST SP 800-34** guidelines.

---

## Scope
- Applies to all **critical workloads** across **Security**, **Log Archive**, **Sandbox**, and **Workloads** OUs.
- Covers:
  - AWS region failures.
  - Data corruption or loss.
  - Ransomware or destructive incidents.
  - Major service outages (affecting multiple accounts).
- Excludes:
  - Routine incident response (covered in **Incident-Response-Workflow.md**).
  - Minor service disruptions (<1 hour, handled by on-call teams).

---

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Disaster Recovery (DR) Lead:** Coordinates the recovery process and communicates with leadership.
- **Cloud Platform Team:** Executes failover and restores AWS infrastructure.
- **Security Team:** Ensures security controls remain intact during and after recovery.
- **Account Owners:** Provide application-specific recovery steps.
- **Compliance Officer:** Ensures documentation for regulatory reporting.

---

## Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** ≤ 4 hours for critical workloads.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** ≤ 1 hour for data with continuous replication.

---

## Workflow

### 1. **Disaster Declaration**
- Disaster declared by:
  - **DR Lead** or **CISO** after initial impact assessment.
- Trigger scenarios:
  - Extended **AWS region outage**.
  - **Data destruction or corruption**.
  - **Catastrophic compromise** (e.g., ransomware).

---

### 2. **Initial Assessment**
- Identify:
  - **Accounts and OUs affected**.
  - **Scope of impact** (services, data, applications).
  - **Dependencies** (cross-account services, shared resources).
- Prioritize:
  - Critical workloads (Prod > Dev/Test > Sandbox).
  - Regulatory/Compliance workloads first.

---

### 3. **Failover & Recovery**
#### **Multi-Region Failover**
- Use **Route 53** failover records to redirect traffic to secondary region.
- Deploy **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** to provision DR environment.

#### **Data Recovery**
- Restore from:
  - **Cross-region S3 replication**.
  - **EBS snapshots** stored in **Log Archive account**.
  - **RDS automated backups** or cross-region replicas.

#### **Compute Recovery**
- Launch **EC2 Auto Scaling Groups** in DR region.
- Validate AMIs and reattach IAM roles.
- For container workloads: Deploy **ECS/EKS clusters** in failover region.

---

### 4. **Security & Compliance**
- Validate:
  - SCPs are enforced in DR region.
  - GuardDuty & Security Hub remain active.
  - CloudTrail logs are captured in the **Log Archive account**.

---

### 5. **Communication**
- Notify:
  - **Internal stakeholders** (Cloud Governance Board, application owners).
  - **Regulators** if required (per GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).
- Provide frequent updates on recovery progress.

---

### 6. **Validation**
- Perform **application-level testing** to confirm recovery success.
- Run **integrity checks** on restored data.
- Monitor **CloudWatch alarms** and **SIEM dashboards** for anomalies.

---

### 7. **Post-Disaster Review**
- Conduct a **post-mortem**:
  - Root cause analysis.
  - Evaluate response effectiveness.
  - Document lessons learned.
- Update:
  - **DR plans**.
  - **IaC templates**.
  - **Runbooks** to improve recovery speed and reliability.

---

## Evidence Handling
- All recovery actions logged in:
  - **Incident Tracking System** (e.g., JIRA, ServiceNow).
  - **CloudTrail** for auditable records.
- Snapshots and backups tagged with `DR-IncidentID`.

---

## Automation Opportunities
- **Automated Failover**:
  - Preconfigured **Route 53 failover records**.
  - **CloudFormation/Terraform scripts** for DR infrastructure.
- **Backup & Replication**:
  - Enable **cross-region S3 replication**.
  - Automate **EBS & RDS snapshot replication**.
- **Runbook Automation**:
  - Integrate with **SSM Documents** for scripted recovery steps.
